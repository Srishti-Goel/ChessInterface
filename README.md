# Chess Interface
(NOTE: This repository is the front-end part of the Chess Player.\
The backend and the actual player is in a separate repository (found here: https://github.com/Srishti-Goel/Chess-Playing-Bot))

## Used Technologies
The technologies used to make this interface were HTML, CSS and React.

## How to play
The interface loads a dual player board, with the board automatically setting from the POV of the black player.\
To make a move, drag and drop the piece from its current location to its desired location.\
\
If you make an invalid move, the piece automatically gets placed to its original position.\
If the move is legal by the rules of Chess, is not an en passant or a castling move, check if your piece is pinned, or you are in a state of check.
